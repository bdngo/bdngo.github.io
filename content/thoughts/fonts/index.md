These are my favorite fonts for my various applications.

# Sans Serif: Atkinson Hyperlegible

[Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont) was designed by the Braille Institute as part of a rebranding effort.
Named after their founder J. Robert Atkinson, the font was designed to maximize legibility for people with vision impairments.
